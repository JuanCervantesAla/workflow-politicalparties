# WORKFLOWS
## This code 
This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow using Prefect to process political party data. The workflow extracts data from a source, applies transformations, and loads the processed data into a database (political_party.db). Prefect is used to manage and automate the data pipeline, ensuring efficient and reliable execution.

## Tools
Python
Prefect 2.0
